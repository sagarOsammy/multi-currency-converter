I want to create a Realtime currency converter, using a free currency conversion API where I can convert between 3 different currencies at the same time.
There should be 3 different text boxes with their corresponding dropdown menu that contains the available currencies for conversion.
The user should be able to chose the currencies they want to convert from and to from these 3 dropdowns.

Once the user have selected the 3 currencies, they should be able to enter the amount they want to convert in any of the 3 text fields, and the other 2 text fields should display the converted amount immediately.

The user should be able to save their preferred currencies in the browser, and there should also be a button to reset their preferred currencies.

Make sure to use a responsive design so that the application looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to create the layout, and make sure to include some basic styling to make the application visually appealing.
You can use bigger font sizes and colors to make the application more user-friendly and use rounded corners and shadows to make the application look modern
